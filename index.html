		<br>We have had a big event called "Olympics" in winter. We have a time of enthusiasm when we see various heroes in the world of fierce competition. Obviously there are results of win and lose in the competition, but we know how valuable their sweat and effort are, regardless of the color of the medal, they did their best and we respect all the players.<br>
		I analyzed the entire data of valuable medals in various fields. Data was provided the IOC Research and Reference Service and published by The Guardian's Datablog</p>
